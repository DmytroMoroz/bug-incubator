And here's our itinerary through Japan from November 2024! We've included the hotel names and the main sights.
We could have easily spent more time in Kyoto; the city is fantastic both culinarily and culturally!
The stopovers in Okayama and Himeji weren't strictly necessary; a day trip is perfectly sufficient for Himeji Castle.
If you need any further tips, feel free to ask. :)
