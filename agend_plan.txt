Excellent. Thank you for the clarifications. A 3-week trip is the perfect amount of time to include all your interests without feeling too rushed. The "mix" pacing is key, and I will build the itinerary around that principle.

You've presented a fun challenge: fitting in the highlights of mainland Japan, the Japan Alps, *and* Okinawa. It's ambitious, but with three weeks, it's possible. I've mapped out two potential high-level plans. I strongly recommend **Option B** as it better aligns with your "not a marathon" preference, but I'll present both for your consideration.

### **Part 2: Itinerary Options & The Blueprint**

#### **Option A: The Ambitious Explorer (Tokyo → Alps → Kyoto → Hiroshima → Okinawa)**

This itinerary includes everything but involves more travel days and potentially 6-7 different hotels. It's a true cross-country experience.

* **Pros:** You see an incredible diversity of Japan, from modern cities to mountain towns to tropical islands.
* **Cons:** It's fast-paced with several long travel days. Less time to relax and soak in each location.

#### **Option B: The Balanced Experience (Tokyo → Hakone → Kyoto → Hiroshima → Okinawa)**

This is my recommended itinerary. It follows the classic "Golden Route" before heading south. It's more logistically straightforward and allows for more downtime and deeper exploration of each area. It perfectly incorporates your request for an *onsen* experience in Hakone.

* **Pros:** Excellent pacing, less time spent in transit, includes the iconic Mt. Fuji/onsen experience, and allows for more relaxation.
* **Cons:** You would skip the Japan Alps (Takayama/Kanazawa).

Given your preference for a mixed pace, I will proceed by building out the detailed plan for **Option B**. If you'd still like to consider Option A, we can adjust.

### **Part 3: The Detailed 20-Day "Balanced Experience" Itinerary**

This plan assumes an "open-jaw" flight: flying into Tokyo (NRT or HND) and out of Osaka (KIX), which is geographically logical after Hiroshima. Flying home from Okinawa (via a hub like Tokyo or Seoul) is also a great option.

**Theme:** A blend of iconic sights and relaxed exploration, with your preferences for food, temples, onsen, and sakura at its core.

#### **Phase 1: The Modern Metropolis - Tokyo (5 Nights)**

* **Day 1: Arrival & Shinjuku Welcome (Wanderer Day)**
* Arrive at Narita (NRT) or Haneda (HND). Clear immigration, pick up pocket Wi-Fi/SIM card. Take the Narita Express or Limousine Bus to your hotel in Shinjuku or Shibuya.
* **Activity:** Settle in. Take an evening walk around Shinjuku. Ascend the **Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building** (it's free!) for stunning panoramic city views.
* **Dinner:** Dive into **Omoide Yokocho** ("Piss Alley"), a famous network of tiny yakitori (grilled skewer) restaurants.


* **Day 2: Tradition & Tech (Explorer Day)**
* **Morning:** Visit **Asakusa**, home to the famous **Senso-ji Temple** and the Kaminarimon Gate.
* **Afternoon:** Explore **Akihabara**, the "Electric Town," famous for anime, manga, and electronics.
* **Evening:** Head to **Shibuya**. Witness the famous **Shibuya Crossing** from the Starbucks overlook, say hello to the Hachiko statue, and explore the vibrant nightlife.
* **Food Focus:** Find a top-rated ramen shop in Shibuya. Ichiran and Ippudo are famous, fail-safe choices for a classic experience.


* **Day 3: Imperial Views & Harajuku Fun (Wanderer Day)**
* **Morning:** Visit the tranquil **Meiji Jingu Shrine**, dedicated to Emperor Meiji, and wander through the adjacent Yoyogi Park.
* **Afternoon:** Stroll down **Takeshita Street** in Harajuku to see Japan's youth fashion culture. Contrast this by walking to the chic, upscale Omotesando avenue nearby.
* **Evening:** Your choice: a relaxed dinner or experience the unique themed **Robot Restaurant** (book well in advance).


* **Day 4: Art or Fish Market (Your Choice Day)**
* **Option A (Art):** Visit the incredible **teamLab Borderless or Planets** digital art museum (book tickets weeks ahead). It's an immersive, unforgettable experience.
* **Option B (Food):** Visit the **Tsukiji Outer Market** for a fantastic seafood breakfast or brunch. Sample fresh sushi, grilled scallops, and tamagoyaki (sweet omelette).
* **Afternoon:** Explore the elegant Ginza district for high-end shopping and art galleries.


* **Day 5: Travel to Hakone (Onsen & Fuji Views)**
* **Activity:** Use a luggage forwarding service (**Takuhaibin**) to send your large suitcase from Tokyo directly to your Kyoto hotel. It's cheap, reliable, and you'll travel light for the next two nights.
* Take the Shinkansen from Tokyo to Odawara, then local transport into the Hakone region.
* **Check-in:** Stay at a **Ryokan** (traditional Japanese inn). This is a highlight.
* **Afternoon:** Do part of the **Hakone Loop**: ride the ropeway for views of the volcanic Owakudani valley and, on a clear day, **Mount Fuji**.
* **Evening:** Enjoy an elaborate **kaiseki** (multi-course) dinner at your ryokan, and then relax in their private or public **onsen** (hot spring bath).



#### **Phase 2: The Cultural Heart - Kyoto & Nara (5 Nights)**

* **Day 6: Hakone Loop & Travel to Kyoto (Explorer Day)**
* **Morning:** Complete the Hakone Loop, including a pirate ship cruise on Lake Ashi and a visit to the Hakone Open-Air Museum.
* **Afternoon:** Travel from Hakone (via Odawara) to Kyoto on the Shinkansen (approx. 2 hours).
* **Evening:** Arrive in Kyoto, check into your hotel (your forwarded luggage should be there). Have a simple dinner near Kyoto Station.


* **Day 7: Iconic Kyoto Temples (Explorer Day)**
* **Morning:** Visit **Kinkaku-ji (The Golden Pavilion)**. Go right at opening time to avoid the worst crowds.
* **Afternoon:** Head to **Fushimi Inari Shrine**, famous for its thousands of red torii gates winding up a mountain. You don't have to hike it all; the first section is the most impressive.
* **Evening:** Explore **Pontocho Alley**, a narrow, atmospheric lane filled with traditional restaurants.


* **Day 8: Arashiyama's Beauty (Wanderer Day)**
* **Morning:** Travel to the Arashiyama district. Walk through the famous **Bamboo Grove** (again, go early!) and visit the serene **Tenryu-ji Temple**.
* **Afternoon:** Cross the Togetsukyo Bridge and visit the **Iwatayama Monkey Park** for great views and cheeky monkeys.
* **Experience:** Book a **Tea Ceremony** experience in this area or back in central Kyoto for an authentic cultural taste.


* **Day 9: Eastern Kyoto & Geishas (Wanderer Day)**
* **Morning:** Walk up the traditional preserved streets of **Higashiyama** to the magnificent **Kiyomizu-dera Temple**, which offers a great view over Kyoto.
* **Afternoon:** Wander through the lanes of **Gion**, Japan's most famous geisha district. You might spot a geiko or maiko in the early evening.
* **Food Focus:** Explore the **Nishiki Market**, Kyoto's kitchen, to sample local delicacies.


* **Day 10: Day Trip to Nara**
* **Activity:** Take a short, easy train ride to Nara, Japan's first permanent capital.
* Visit **Todai-ji Temple** to see the giant bronze Buddha statue.
* Wander through **Nara Park**, feeding the famous semi-wild (but very polite) bowing deer.
* Return to Kyoto for your final evening.



#### **Phase 3: History & Reflection - Hiroshima (2 Nights)**

* **Day 11: Travel to Hiroshima & Miyajima Island**
* Forward your main luggage from Kyoto to your Okinawa hotel.
* Take the Shinkansen from Kyoto to Hiroshima. Store your overnight bag in a locker at the station and visit the **Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park and Museum**. It is a deeply moving and essential experience.
* **Afternoon:** Take a local train and ferry to **Miyajima Island**.
* **Activity:** I highly recommend **staying overnight on Miyajima Island**. Once the day-trippers leave, the island is quiet and magical. Watch the sunset over the famous "floating" Itsukushima Shrine torii gate.


* **Day 12: Miyajima & Travel Prep**
* **Morning:** At high tide, the **Itsukushima Shrine** appears to float on water. Visit the shrine itself and hike up Mount Misen (or take the ropeway) for spectacular views.
* **Afternoon:** Return to Hiroshima. From here, we prepare for the Okinawa flight. The best way is to take a short Shinkansen ride to **Fukuoka (Hakata Station)** and stay overnight near the airport for an easy morning departure.
* **Dinner:** Fukuoka is the home of Tonkotsu (pork bone broth) ramen. Have a farewell-to-mainland bowl at a **Yatai** (open-air food stall).



#### **Phase 4: Tropical Paradise - Okinawa (4 Nights)**

* **Day 13: Flight to Okinawa & Beach Time**
* **Morning:** Take a morning flight from Fukuoka (FUK) to Naha, Okinawa (OKA).
* **Activity:** Pick up a rental car at the airport. It's the best way to explore Okinawa's main island.
* Drive to your hotel. I recommend staying in the Onna Village area, which has beautiful beaches and is a great base for exploring.
* **Afternoon:** Relax on **Manza Beach** or your hotel's beach. Let the tropical pace sink in.


* **Day 14: Ocean Wonders (Explorer Day)**
* **Activity:** Drive north to the magnificent **Churaumi Aquarium**, one of the largest in the world, famous for its massive Kuroshio Tank with whale sharks and manta rays.
* Explore the surrounding Ocean Expo Park.


* **Day 15: History & Culture (Wanderer Day)**
* **Morning:** Visit **Shuri Castle** (currently under reconstruction after a fire, but the park and surrounding areas are still worth seeing) in Naha to learn about the history of the Ryukyu Kingdom.
* **Afternoon:** Explore **Kokusai Dori**, Naha's main tourist street, for shopping and Okinawan food. Try "Okinawa soba" (different from mainland soba) and "goya chanpuru" (bitter melon stir-fry).
* Alternatively, find a snorkeling or diving tour if that's of interest.


* **Day 16: Free Day & Farewell Dinner**
* Your choice: Discover a hidden beach, visit the peaceful southeast coast and Cape Chinen, or do some last-minute souvenir shopping.
* Enjoy a final Okinawan dinner.



#### **Phase 5: The Journey Home (1 Night)**

* **Day 17 - 20 (Flexible 3-4 days at the end):**
* **Departure Logistics:** From Okinawa (OKA), you'll take a domestic flight back to a major international airport for your flight home. This is most likely **Tokyo (HND/NRT)** or **Osaka (KIX)**.
* **Plan:** Fly from Naha to Tokyo in the morning. Book a hotel near Haneda/Narita airport. Have one last amazing Japanese dinner, perhaps some of the best sushi you've missed, and relax before your long flight home the next day.
* The remaining days are buffer days that can be allocated based on preference e.g. an extra day in Kyoto, or an extra day in Okinawa etc.

### **Part 4: The Practical Guide & Budget**

**Budget Estimate (For 2 People, ~20 Days, Mid-Range):**

* **International Flights (VIE ↔ TYO/OSA):** ~€2,400 - €3,000 (Booking early is key for April)
* **Domestic Flights (FUK → OKA, OKA → HND):** ~€300 - €500
* **Accommodation (19 nights @ ~€120/night avg.):** ~€2,280 (Mix of business hotels, with one more expensive Ryokan night)
* **Ground Transport (Individual Trains, Metro):** ~€600 (€300 pp). This includes all your Shinkansen tickets.
* **Food & Drink (€70/day for two):** ~€1,400
* **Activities, Entrance Fees, Misc:** ~€800
* **Total Estimated Budget:** **€7,780 - €8,580** (This aligns with the lower end of our estimate, achievable with smart booking).

**Key Logistics:**

* **Flights:** Book an "open-jaw" or "multi-city" ticket. Something like Vienna -> Tokyo and Osaka -> Vienna OR Vienna -> Tokyo and Tokyo -> Vienna (with the domestic Okinawa flights booked separately). Compare both options. **Start looking in Summer 2025.**
* **Japan Rail Pass - IMPORTANT:** With this itinerary and the 2023 price hike, the **Japan Rail Pass is NOT worth the cost**. It is significantly cheaper to buy your Shinkansen tickets individually. This is a major change from old travel advice.
* **Connectivity:** Rent a pocket Wi-Fi device or buy a data-only SIM card. You can pick it up at the airport. Essential for navigation.
* **Essential Apps:** Google Maps (works perfectly for train schedules), Google Translate (the camera function is a lifesaver for menus), and Tabelog (for restaurant discovery, though mostly in Japanese, the ratings are reliable).
* **What to Pack:** Comfortable walking shoes are non-negotiable. Pack layers for April, as mornings can be cool. A portable battery charger, some cash (many smaller shops and restaurants are still cash-only), and a small reusable bag.

This detailed plan should serve as a strong foundation. Please read it over and let me know your thoughts. We can tweak days, substitute activities, or change the number of nights in any city to make it perfect for you.
