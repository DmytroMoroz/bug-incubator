## Money & Payments

### Cash vs Cards

Japan is increasingly cashless, BUT:
- Small restaurants often cash-only
- Some temples/shrines cash-only
- Vending machines accept IC cards
- Larger establishments accept credit cards

**Recommendation:** Carry ¥10,000-20,000 cash at all times

### Getting Cash in Japan

| Where | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| **7-Eleven ATMs** | Accept foreign cards, everywhere |
| **Japan Post ATMs** | Post offices, reliable |
| **Airport ATMs** | Get first cash on arrival |

**Tip:** Withdraw larger amounts less often (some ATMs charge per transaction)

### IC Cards (Suica vs ICOCA vs PASMO)

**GET ONE IMMEDIATELY** at the airport.

#### Which Card to Get?

| Card | Issued By | Where to Buy | Best For |
|------|-----------|--------------|----------|
| **Suica** | JR East | Tokyo airports & stations | Arriving in Tokyo |
| **ICOCA** | JR West | Kansai airports & stations | Arriving in Osaka/Kyoto |
| **PASMO** | Tokyo Metro | Tokyo metro stations | Alternative to Suica |

**The truth: They all work everywhere in Japan!** Suica works in Osaka, ICOCA works in Tokyo - full interoperability nationwide. Pick based on where you arrive.

**For your trip: Get Suica** (you arrive in Tokyo). Specifically, get **Welcome Suica** at the airport.

#### Card Options

| Card Type | Cost | Validity | Refund | Notes |
|-----------|------|----------|--------|-------|
| **Welcome Suica** | ¥1,000-5,000 (no deposit) | 28 days | No refund | Best for tourists <28 days |
| **Regular Suica/ICOCA** | ¥2,000 (¥500 deposit + ¥1,500 balance) | No expiry | Yes, refundable | Better for repeat visitors |

#### What IC Cards Cover
- Train/metro fares (tap in/out)
- Bus fares
- Convenience stores (7-Eleven, Lawson, FamilyMart)
- Vending machines
- Many restaurants and shops
- Coin lockers

#### What They DON'T Cover
- Shinkansen (bullet train) - need separate ticket
- Reserved express trains - need separate ticket
- Some rural buses

**How to use:** Tap card on reader at ticket gates, machines, payment terminals. Balance deducted automatically.

**Recharging:** At any train station ticket machine (look for IC card top-up), or at convenience store registers.

#### Digital IC Cards (Apple Wallet / Google Pay)

**Yes, ICOCA (and Suica) work in Apple Wallet!**

| Feature | Physical Card | Digital (Apple Wallet) |
|---------|---------------|------------------------|
| **Top-up** | Cash at machines/konbini | Apple Pay OR cash at konbini |
| **Convenience** | Need to carry card | Phone always with you |
| **Express Mode** | N/A | Tap without unlocking phone |
| **Battery dies** | Still works | Card won't work |
| **Sharing** | Can lend to friend | Tied to your device |

**How to add ICOCA to Apple Wallet:**

**⚠️ Important: You CANNOT have the same card both physical AND digital.**
When you transfer a physical card to Apple Wallet, the physical card is permanently deactivated. But you CAN have two separate cards (one physical + one new digital).

**Option 1: Transfer existing physical card**
1. Open Wallet → Add → Transit Card → ICOCA
2. Choose "Transfer Existing Card"
3. Place physical card under top of iPhone
4. ⚠️ **Physical card becomes unusable** after transfer (balance moves to phone)

**Option 2: Create NEW digital ICOCA** (keep physical card working)
1. Open Wallet → Add → Transit Card → ICOCA
2. Choose amount to add (min ¥1,000)
3. Pay with card in Apple Wallet
4. ✅ Your physical card stays active - now you have TWO separate cards

**Top-up with Apple Pay:** Yes! Open Wallet → select ICOCA → Add Money → pay with your card.

⚠️ **Foreign card note:** Some non-Japanese cards only allow top-ups while you're physically in Japan. If it doesn't work before your trip, it should work once you arrive. Alternatively, top up with cash at any convenience store or station.

**Recommendation for your trip:**
Since you have 2 physical ICOCA cards, best options:

| Strategy | Person 1 | Person 2 | Pros |
|----------|----------|----------|------|
| **A: Both physical** | Physical ICOCA | Physical ICOCA | Simple, works if phones die |
| **B: Mix** | Physical ICOCA | Transfer → digital | Best of both worlds |
| **C: Physical + new digital** | Physical ICOCA + new digital | Physical ICOCA | Backup on same person |

Option A or B recommended - keeps things simple!

### Credit Cards

| Accepted | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| **Visa** | Most widely accepted |
| **Mastercard** | Good acceptance |
| **Amex** | Limited, larger places only |
| **JCB** | Japanese card, good acceptance |

**Tip:** Notify your bank of travel dates to avoid blocks

## Transport Notes

### Why NO JR Pass for This Trip

After 2023 price increase, JR Pass is NOT cost-effective for your route:

| Your Route | Individual Cost |
|------------|----------------|
| Tokyo → Hakone/Odawara | ~€25/person |
| Odawara → Kyoto | ~€75/person |
| Kyoto → Hiroshima | ~€65/person |
| **Total** | ~€165/person |

**7-Day JR Pass: €310/person** - You'd lose money!

*Note: You fly to Okinawa, so no train back to Tokyo*

### Luggage Forwarding (Takuhaibin)

**Use this service!** Send your big luggage ahead:
- Tokyo → Kyoto (send before leaving for Hakone)
- Kyoto → Okinawa hotel (send before leaving for Hiroshima)

| Service | Where to Send | Cost | Delivery |
|---------|---------------|------|----------|
| **Yamato (Kuroneko)** | Hotel front desks, convenience stores | ~¥2,000/bag | Next day (or same day in cities) |

**How:** Ask hotel front desk, fill out form, pay, done!

### Shinkansen Tips

- **Reserved seats recommended** for peace of mind
- Book at station on day of travel (usually fine)
- Or use **SmartEX app** for advance booking
- **Nozomi** = fastest (not covered by JR Pass anyway)

## Wi-Fi & Connectivity

**You need internet in Japan!** Your Austrian/EU roaming won't work (Japan is not in the EU) and carrier roaming is very expensive.

### Recommended: eSIM (Easiest Option)

**What is it?** A digital SIM you download to your phone. No physical card, no pickup, no return.

**Best provider: [Ubigi](https://www.ubigi.com/)**
- Buy online before your trip
- Scan QR code to install (5 minutes)
- Activate when you land in Japan
- Your physical SIM stays in phone (keeps your number for WhatsApp/iMessage)

| Ubigi Japan Plans | Data | Cost |
|-------------------|------|------|
| 10 days | 10GB | ~€18 |
| 30 days | 10GB | ~€22 |
| 30 days | 50GB | ~€50 |

**For your 20-day trip:** 10GB or 50GB plan depending on usage. 10GB is fine if you use WiFi at hotels.

**Requirements:** iPhone XS or newer (or modern Android with eSIM support)

### Alternative Options

| Option | Setup | Cost (20 days) | Best For |
|--------|-------|----------------|----------|
| **eSIM (Ubigi)** | Download before trip | €20-50/person | ✅ Recommended for couples |
| **Physical SIM** | Buy at airport, swap card | €40-50/person | Phones without eSIM |
| **Pocket WiFi** | Pick up & return at airport | €80-120 shared | Groups 3+, heavy streaming |
| **Carrier roaming** | Nothing to do | ❌ Very expensive | Don't use! |

### Pocket WiFi (If You Prefer)

A small portable router you carry. Creates WiFi hotspot for multiple devices.

**Pros:** Share between 2 phones, often "unlimited" data
**Cons:** Extra device to charge daily, must return at airport, loss fee ~€150

**Providers:** Japan Wireless, Ninja WiFi, Sakura Mobile
**Pickup:** Airport counter or hotel delivery (order online in advance)

### Free WiFi in Japan

Available at:
- Most hotels
- Convenience stores (7-Eleven, Lawson, FamilyMart)
- Train stations
- Starbucks, cafes
- Shopping malls

**But:** Not reliable enough to depend on. Get eSIM or pocket WiFi for navigation and translation.
