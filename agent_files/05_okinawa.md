## Why Okinawa

Okinawa is Japan's tropical paradise - a chain of islands with a distinct culture, cuisine, and history. Once the independent Ryukyu Kingdom, it has its own language, music, and traditions. The main island offers beautiful beaches, world-class diving, unique food, and a laid-back atmosphere that's completely different from mainland Japan.

**Weather in late April:** 24-26°C, warm, great for beaches!

---

## Top Highlights

1. **Churaumi Aquarium** - World-famous, massive whale shark tank
2. **Beautiful beaches** - Manza, Emerald, countless others
3. **Shuri Castle** - Ryukyu Kingdom palace (partially reconstructed)
4. **Okinawan food** - Completely different from mainland cuisine
5. **Snorkeling/Diving** - World-class coral reefs

## IMPORTANT: Rental Car

**A rental car is ESSENTIAL in Okinawa.** 

Public transportation is extremely limited outside Naha city. The monorail only serves Naha, and buses are infrequent and slow.

### What You Need
- **International Driving Permit (IDP)** - Get this in your home country BEFORE the trip!
- **Book in advance** - April is expensive (~€60-75/day)
- **Pick up at Naha Airport** - Most convenient

### Rental Tips
- Book through **Nippon Rent-A-Car**, **Times**, **Toyota**, or **OTS**
- Get basic insurance (included in most rentals)
- GPS is usually included (set to English)
- Okinawa drives on the LEFT (same as rest of Japan)
