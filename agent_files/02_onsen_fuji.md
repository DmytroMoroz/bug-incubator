## At a Glance

| | |
|---|---|
| **Nights** | 1 |
| **Main Goal** | Onsen (hot spring) with Mt. Fuji view |
| **Budget** | €200-350 for ryokan (includes dinner + breakfast) |
| **Best For** | Relaxation, traditional Japanese experience |

---

## Why This Matters

Your girlfriend specifically requested an onsen with a view of Mount Fuji. This is a classic, bucket-list Japanese experience - soaking in natural hot springs while gazing at Japan's iconic mountain.

**Important:** Fuji views are weather-dependent. Clear mornings (especially sunrise) offer the best chance.

---

## Two Location Options

You have a choice between two areas. Both offer onsen experiences, but they differ in Fuji view reliability.

### Option A: Lake Kawaguchiko (RECOMMENDED)
**Best for: Guaranteed Mt. Fuji views**

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Direct, unobstructed Fuji views | Slightly longer travel (2h from Tokyo) |
| Lake + mountain = stunning scenery | Less "onsen town" atmosphere |
| Many ryokans have Fuji-view rooms | Requires backtracking to reach Kyoto |

### Option B: Hakone
**Best for: Convenience, classic onsen town**

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| On the way to Kyoto (easier logistics) | Fuji views are weather-dependent |
| Classic onsen resort town | Mountains may block Fuji |
| More activities (ropeway, lake, museums) | Less reliable Fuji sighting |

**My recommendation:** Choose **Kawaguchiko** if Mt. Fuji view is the priority. The slight travel inconvenience is worth it for the guaranteed view.

## Booking Tips

1. **Book 2-3 months ahead** - Good ryokans sell out, especially for weekends
2. **Book directly** on ryokan website for best rates
3. **Specify room preference** - Request Fuji-view room explicitly
4. **Check cancellation policy** - Usually strict (7-14 days)
5. **Confirm dietary needs** - Kaiseki is fish-heavy; vegetarian options possible with advance notice

---

## Budget Note

Ryokan stays seem expensive (€200-350) but include:
- Accommodation
- Elaborate dinner
- Traditional breakfast
- Onsen access
- Yukata and amenities

This is actually good value compared to hotel + separate dinner.
