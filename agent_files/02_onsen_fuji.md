> - 📅 **Planned for:** Day 5 (April 13) but can be moved to any Tokyo day

## If Weather is Bad

If Mt. Fuji isn't visible, **don't go**. Do a Tokyo activity instead:

- Tokyo National Museum
- Yanaka/Nezu neighborhood
- Shopping day
- TeamLab (if you want to add it)

Check again next day. If all Tokyo days are cloudy, skip Kawaguchiko entirely - you'll still have a great trip.
