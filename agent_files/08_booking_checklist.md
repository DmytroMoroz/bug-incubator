## Booking Tips

### Flights

- **Check multi-city** options (fly into Tokyo, out of Tokyo)
- **Book on Tuesday/Wednesday** - often cheapest
- **Set price alerts** on Google Flights

### Hotels
- **Booking.com** - largest selection, free cancellation often available
- **Agoda** - sometimes cheaper for Asia
- **Direct booking** - sometimes best rate + perks
- **Check location** - near metro station is key

### Ryokans
- **Book direct** for best rates and room requests
- **Specify Fuji-view room** if that's your priority
- **Check cancellation policy** - often strict (7-14 days)
- **Note dietary restrictions** - kaiseki dinner is fish-heavy

### Domestic Flights Japan
- **ANA/JAL** - reliable, slightly pricier

- **Book 1-2 months ahead** for best prices
