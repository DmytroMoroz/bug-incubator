**Tips for Day 2:**

- Yanaka/Nezu: This is "shitamachi" (old downtown) - narrow alleys, wooden houses, traditional shops
- Optional: Book a cultural workshop in Yanaka (calligraphy, wagashi making)
- Shibuya Crossing: best viewed from above

**Why Yanaka/Nezu instead of Akihabara:** These neighborhoods preserve authentic Edo-period atmosphere - the Japan that existed before modernization. Perfect contrast to Asakusa's temple with a more local, less touristy feel. Akihabara (anime/gaming district) moved to [alternatives](01a_tokyo_alternatives.md).

## Where to Stay in Tokyo

### Best Areas for First-Time Visitors

| Area | Why Stay Here | Pros | Cons | Price Range |
|------|---------------|------|------|-------------|
| **Shinjuku** | Major transport hub, central | Easy access everywhere, lots of dining/nightlife, views | Can be overwhelming, crowded | €70-120/night |
| **Shibuya** | Young, trendy, central | Near Harajuku/Omotesando, iconic crossing, vibrant | Noisy, very crowded | €80-130/night |
| **Asakusa** | Traditional atmosphere | Near Senso-ji, budget-friendly, authentic feel | Farther from Shibuya/Shinjuku | €50-90/night |

### Our Recommendation: **Shinjuku**

**Why Shinjuku is best for your trip:**
- **Transport hub**: Shinjuku Station is the world's busiest - trains go everywhere
- **Easy airport access**: Direct Narita Express from airport
- **Walking distance**: Government Building views, Golden Gai, Omoide Yokocho
- **Variety**: Everything from budget to luxury hotels
- **Nightlife**: Great evening options without needing transport

**Specifically, stay near:**
- **Shinjuku Station West Exit**: Business hotels, quieter, near Government Building
- **Shinjuku Station East Exit**: More entertainment, closer to Golden Gai
- **Avoid**: Kabukicho red-light district (unless you want that vibe)

### Hotel Types in Japan

|------|-------------|-------|-------|
| **Business Hotel** | Compact, efficient, clean | €60-100 | Best value for couples, e.g., APA, Tokyu Stay, Mitsui Garden |
| **Capsule Hotel** | Pod-style sleeping | €30-50 | Fun to try once, but not for couples |
| **Ryokan** | Traditional Japanese inn | €150-400 | Save this for Hakone/Kawaguchiko |
