## Detailed Descriptions

### Akihabara (Skipped from main plan)

**Why we skipped it:** Not aligned with your interests (anime/gaming focus)

**If you change your mind:**
- Best on weekday afternoons (less crowded)
- Main attractions: Yodobashi Camera (8 floors electronics), Don Quijote, anime figure shops
- Maid cafes: Unique experience where waitresses in costumes serve you
- Retro gaming: Super Potato has vintage games/consoles

**Time needed:** 2-4 hours depending on interest level

---

### TeamLab Planets (Moved to alternative)

**Why it's popular:** Truly unique immersive art - you walk barefoot through water with digital koi fish, lie down surrounded by infinity lights, etc.

**Why we replaced it:** You preferred traditional Japanese history museum

**If you change your mind:**
- **MUST book 2-3 weeks ahead** - sells out!
- Wear shorts/skirt (you wade through knee-deep water)
- Located in Toyosu, ~20 min from central Tokyo
- Best in afternoon (fewer children)
- Price: ~¥3,800/person

**Website:** teamlab.art

### Tokyo Skytree

**What it is:** World's tallest tower (634m), observation decks at 350m and 450m

**Why visit:**
- Best city views in Tokyo
- Good rainy/cloudy day activity (go above the clouds!)
- Shopping mall and aquarium at base
- Near Asakusa (combine in one trip)

**Tip:** Sunset timing is magical but most crowded

**Price:** ¥2,100-3,100 depending on deck

---

### Disneyland / DisneySea

**DisneySea is unique to Japan** and consistently rated world's best Disney park.

**Why consider:**
- DisneySea has mature theming (less kiddie than Disneyland)
- Excellent for couples
- Uniquely Japanese Disney experience

**Why we didn't include:**
- Takes a full day
- €80-100/person entrance
- Not essential for Japan cultural experience

**If you want to go:** Replace a Tokyo day, book tickets in advance

---

### Sumo

**Tournament schedule 2026:** January, May, September (Tokyo)

Your trip (April) misses Tokyo tournaments, BUT:
- **Morning practice visits** possible at some stables (arrange in advance)
- **Ryogoku district** still worth visiting for atmosphere and chanko-nabe
